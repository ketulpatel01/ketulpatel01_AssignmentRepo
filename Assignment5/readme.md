## Steps Followed
1: Crowdfunding Contract: Create a Solidity smart contract for a crowdfunding platform. The contract should allow users to create crowdfunding campaigns with a target amount and a deadline. Participants can contribute funds to these campaigns, and the contract should track the total contributions. Implement a function to finalize the campaign: if the target is met by the deadline, release the funds to the campaign creator; otherwise, allow contributors to withdraw their 
funds  ==> CrowdFunding.sol

2: Voting System Contract: Create a Solidity smart contract for a voting system where participants can vote on multiple proposals. The contract should allow users to propose new options, cast votes, and view the current results. Ensure that each address can vote only once per proposal, and implement a function to determine the winning proposal based on the highest number of votes.  ==> VotingSystem.sol
