## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Setup

### Prerequisites:
- **Node.js** (v14 or later)
- **MetaMask**: Browser extension for interacting with Ethereum.
- **Ethereum Testnet**: You can use testnets like Ropsten or Goerli for development and testing.

### Installation Steps:
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ketulpatel01/ketulpatel01_AssignmentRepo/tree/main/Final%20Assignment
   cd ethereum-lottery-dapp
   ```

2. **Install project dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure it as follows:

   API_URL=https://goerli.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
   CONTRACT_ADDRESS=deployed_contract_address_here
   ```

üõ†Ô∏è **Usage**

### Running the App:
1. To deploy the contract on an Ethereum testnet, run:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
   ```

2. Once deployed, update `constants.js` with the contract's ABI and address.

3. Start the frontend:
